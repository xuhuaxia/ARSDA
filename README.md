# ARSDA
Analyzing RNA-Seq Data
The ARSDA program was compiled in Visual Studio 2013. I tested on several computers and did not find any problem. As GitHub limits file size to 25MB, I deleted one file (blastn_vdb.exe) which is used in only one function (to blast NCBI .sra files) in ARSDA that you may never access. You can download the file from NCBI or request from me in case you need it.
